BlingBlong!
BlingBlong is a small "game" I made for a school project. The "game" prints numbers 1 to 100 in the console. If a number is a multiple of three it will print "Bling" instead of the number, if a number is a multiple of five it will print "Blong", and for numbers which are multiples of both three and five it will print "BlingBlong".
there is also a second "game" that will print a list of numbers where each number is the sum of the previous two numbers. The method has a parameter that specifies how many numbers to be computed and printed.
